          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold my-3">What are car brake pads?</h2>
          <p>
            Disc brakes are a standard feature on modern cars. Brake rotors
            attached to the wheels rotate with the wheel. Brake callipers
            pressurize the rotors in response to applying brake pressure. The
            purpose of the brake pads is to metal-on-metal friction. The
            friction between the rotor and the calliper. It's time to replace
            the pads. A driver may hear a screeching sound or see the car pull
            to a stop sign when they apply the brakes. These show signs of wear
            on the pads. When Should I <Link className="text-red-500 underline" href="https://24carservicedubai.com/#contact">Change the Brake Pads on My Car?</Link>  You
            should change Brake pads after every 25,000 to 65,000 miles. You
            should change brake rotors after every 30,000 to 70,000 miles on
            average.

            The precise symptoms when changing car brake pads and rotors.
          </h3>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold ml-5 my-2">
            1. Brake-related squeaking or squealing
          </p>

          <p className="my-2">
            This is the first sign that your brake pads are getting close to the
            end of their usable life. When it is a squeaking or screaming sound
            emanating from the brakes. The most common reason for brake pads to
            squeal is excessive wear and tear. After you have worn down the
            pads, you'll hear a grinding sound. After that, your rotors will
            start to get damaged, increasing the cost of the repair.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold ml-5 my-2">
            2. Grinding Noise When Applying Brake
          </p>

          <p className="my-2">
            As mentioned before, you should replace your brake pads as soon as
            possible. After you hear a grinding sound when you depress the brake
            pedal. Certain brake pads come with integrated metal wear
            indicators. They alert you when pads need replacing. You run the
            risk of suffering far more damage. Pay more for repairs if you let
            the brake pads grind any further.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold ml-5 my-2">
            3. Shaking While Applying Brake
          </p>

          <p>
            You apply the brake pedal and feel your automobile trembling.
            There's a problem with the brakes. The brakes are likely acting
            since the car's rotors, which aid in stopping it, are no longer
            smooth. To get your car fixed, you need to take it to a
            professional.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold ml-5 my-2">
            4. It Took More Time To Stop
          </p>

          <p className="my-2">
            It causes a decrease in brake performance. This is a significant
            indicator that your brakes need maintenance. It could be a sign that
            your brake fluid is low (usually from a leak). Your brake pads are
            entirely worn down if you're having trouble stopping while applying
            the brakes. To make sure you maintain all your braking capabilities.
            You should see a brake mechanic as soon as possible for a thorough
            grasp of what's wrong with your brakes.

            Brake warning lights are standard on the majority of current cars.
            It also displays on the dashboard. Your brake system warning light
            is the other, and the first is your Antilock Braking System (ABS)
            light. When you use your parking brake, your brake light lights on
            your dash. It doesn't always come on when there's a problem. If your
            brake warning light is on and your parking brake is not engaged,
            have a brake specialist inspect your system.

            6. When the Brake Pads on Your Vehicle Are Too Thick
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Inspecting your brake pads for wear is a simple way to keep an eye
            on their condition. Check your brake pad by inspecting the space
            between the wheel's links.

            How To Replace Car Brake Pad ?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold my-2 ml-2">1. SAFE FIRST</p>
            <p>
              Place the car on a level, dry area and secure the wheels with
              wheel chocks. Always be sure to safeguard your hands and eyes by
              using safety goggles and gloves.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              {" "}
              When raising the car, use caution. Select suitable jack positions
              to connect the jack and jack stands.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold my-2 ml-2">
              2. Verify the brake fluid level.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Examine the brake fluid reservoir by opening the hood. It needs to
              have some fluid evacuated if it's full. This will reduce the
              likelihood of spillage during the brake calliper piston's
              compression.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold my-2 ml-2">
              3. HOLD UP THE CAR AND TAKE OFF THE WHEEL
            </p>
            <p>
              When the wheel is stationary and on the ground, use a breaker bar
              and socket to loosen the wheel nuts. Using a hydraulic jack, raise
              the car from a safe location. After positioning a jack stand or
              stands beneath the proper locations, you can drop the car onto the
              jack stands. Take off the wheel and the lug nuts
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold my-2 ml-2">
              4.TAKE OUT THE CALLIPER AND THE BOLTS
            </p>
            <h3>
              The calliper bolts should be rather easy to access. Turning the
              wheel to the left or right will help access. After removing the
              calliper, hang it on a bungee cord. Note: Depending on your car,
              removing the calliper could need different methods.
            </h3>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold my-2 ml-2">
              5.TAKE OUT THE ROTOR AND OLD PADS
            </p>
            <p>
              Examine the worn-out pads for any irregularities in wear. Uneven
              wear might be a sign of a sticky calliper piston, worn pad or
              calliper hardware, or the pad or pads "sticking." There will be a
              guide available for checking the brake pad box for uneven wear.
              After removing the pads, take out the rotor. To remove the rotor
              on many cars, you'll need to remove the mounting bracket for the
              calliper. A bolt through the brake calliper attachment bracket
              secures it to the spindle assembly. Remove the brake calliper and
              brake calliper bracket before removing the brake rotor. This will
              make the rotor accessible. Be cautious not to remove the rotor if
              there is any uneven wear or rust. You need to complete the removal
              of it from the hub assembly. So, you might need help using a
              mallet or rust penetrant such as PB B'laster.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-bold my-2 ml-2">
              6. CLEAN THE SURFACE OF THE ROTOR MOUNTING
            </p>
            <p>
              To get rid of rust and debris, use a wire brush to clean the hub
              surface. This will remove the chance of pedal pulsation and
              guarantee that the new rotor rests flush on the hub. Thin as a
              sheet of paper, rust might be the source of a pulsating pedal.

            <p className="text-xl font-bold my-2 ml-2">
              7. WASH THE NEW OUTER ROTOR
            </p>
            <p>
              Get some Brake Cleaner from AutoZone. Skip this step if your
              Duralast Gold Rotors are rust-resistant.

              9. SETUP BRAKE COMPONENTS
            </p>
            <p>
              Install new hardware in place of the brake hardware. At low
              stopping speeds, worn brake hardware produces vibrations. That is
              audible as brake noise. Every brake service requires replacing
              these clips. You need to attach the hardware. Make sure to
              lubricate the slider contact points with brake lubricant.

            </p>
            <p>
              To ensure proper pad installation, take note of the wear-sensor
              position orientation. <Link className="text-red-500 underline" href="https://www.bosch-mobility.com/en/solutions/sensors/brake-pad-wear-sensor/">Wear-sensor positioning</Link> varies amongst pads.

              12. Examine the piston and brake calliper, then compress.
            </p>
            Examine the brake calliper and piston to check for any leaks of
            brake fluid. To seat the calliper piston, if the calliper and piston
            are clean, use the front/rear disc brake pad spreader set. The
            spreader set is available for free loan from any AutoZone via
            Loan-A-Tool. Certain rear disc brakes have calliper pistons that
            screw in. It is necessary to seat the disc brake pad spreader set
            for them to work.

              IMPORTANT: It's important not to overtighten the calliper bolts.
              This may trigger far more serious issues. To tighten the bolts,
              start by using a socket and finish with a torque wrench. Via
              Loan-A-Tool, you may get a free torque wrench at any AutoZone. For
