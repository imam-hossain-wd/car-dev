          A brief explanation of some of the most popular dashboard lights. That
          might come on when anything is wrong.

        <p>
          One of two factors might be causing the "old school oil can" indicator
          to glow: Either the engine's oil level is low, or the oil pressure has
          dropped. You should contact your nearby Pit Stop shop right away to
          have this warning light looked at if it is remaining on.
        </p>
        <h6 className="text-xl font-bold">Check engine light:</h6>

        <p>
          One of the most often observed dashboard lights is the "engine check"
          light, This illuminates when there are any issues with your engine,
          exhaust system, or ECU. ECU refers to a computerized engine control
          unit. The automobile could still function well. It depends on the
          problem. But you should get it diagnosed by our tech-savvy
          professionals. We'll do a diagnostic check. We also provide advice on

          Symbols for engine temperature sign:
        </h6>

        <p>
          Now, it's typical to see these lights instead of the conventional
          temperature gauge. When the car is chilly or still warming up, a blue
          light usually illuminates and turns off when the temperature reaches
          the standard operating level. If the light is red or flashing, take
          your car to a Car Dev service centre immediately. This indicates that
          the cooling system is beyond the recommended operating temperature
          level. Driving further might cause major engine damage. The greatest
          defence against those warning lights appearing often is routine
          maintenance!

            Modern cars are computer-controlled, so if anything goes wrong, a

            your technician. Make sure the technician is a certified,
            experienced person that you know and trust. Most contemporary cars
            need advanced diagnostic instruments and competent specialists to

            majority of autos, yet even this light cannot pinpoint the precise
